The Template Method pattern can be used to provide a standardized user interface and workflow for different types of payment methods, making the platform easier to navigate and use.



###### Observer Pattern

- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Example: A web application that needs to notify users of updates to a particular resource (e.g. blog post, news article, etc.).

```java
public interface Subject {
    public void attach(Observer observer);
    public void detach(Observer observer);
    public void notifyObservers();
}

public class Resource implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String content;
    
    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }
    
    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }
    
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(content);
        }
    }
    
    public void setContent(String content) {
        this.content = content;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

public interface Observer {
    public void update(String content);
}

public class User implements Observer {
    private String name;
    
    public User(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void update(String content) {
        // Implement user notification logic
    }
}
```

###### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

- Allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Example: A web application that needs to handle different types of requests (e.g. HTTP requests, database requests, etc.) using different handlers.

```java
public interface RequestHandler {
    public void handleRequest(Request request);
}
public class HTTPRequestHandler implements RequestHandler {
    private RequestHandler nextHandler;
    public void setNextHandler(RequestHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }
    public void handleRequest(Request request) {
        if (request.getType() == Request.Type.HTTP) {
            // Implement HTTP request handling logic
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        } else {
            // No more handlers in the chain, cannot handle request
        }
    }
}
public class DatabaseRequestHandler implements RequestHandler {
    private RequestHandler nextHandler;
    public void setNextHandler(RequestHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }
    public void handleRequest(Request request) {
        if (request.getType() == Request.Type.DATABASE) {
            // Implement database request handling logic
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        } else {
            // No more handlers in the chain, cannot handle request
        }
    }
}

public class Request { 
    public enum Type {
        HTTP, 
        DATABASE
    }
    
    private Type type;
    
    public Request(Type type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
    
    public Type getType() {
        return type;
    }
}
```

###### Command Pattern

- Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Example: A web application that needs to implement an undo/redo feature for user actions.

```java
public interface Command {
    public void execute();
    public void undo();
}

public class CreateCommand implements Command {
    private Object object;
    
    public CreateCommand(Object object) {
        this.object = object;
    }
    
    public void execute() {
        // Implement create object logic
    }
    
    public void undo() {
        // Implement undo create object logic
    }
}

public class UpdateCommand implements Command {
    private Object object;
    
    public UpdateCommand(Object object) {
        this.object = object;
    }
    
    public void execute() {
        // Implement update object logic
    }
    
    public void undo() {
        // Implement undo update object logic
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand implements Command {
    private Object object;
    
    public DeleteCommand(Object object) {
        this.object = object;
    }
    
    public void execute() {
        // Implement delete object logic
    }
    
    public void undo() {
        // Implement undo delete object logic
    }
}

public class CommandInvoker {
    private Stack<Command> undoStack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Command> redoStack = new Stack<>();
    
    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        undoStack.push(command);
        redoStack.clear();
    }
    
    public void undoCommand() {
        if (!undoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = undoStack.pop();
            command.undo();
            redoStack.push(command);
        }
    }
    
    public void redoCommand() {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = redoStack.pop();
            command.execute();
            undoStack.push(command);
        }
    }
}
```

###### Strategy Pattern

- Allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

Example: A web application that needs to implement different types of search algorithms (e.g. linear search, binary search, etc.).

```java
public interface SearchStrategy {
    public int search(int[] array, int key);
}

public class LinearSearchStrategy implements SearchStrategy {
    public int search(int[] array, int key) {
        // Implement linear search algorithm
    }
}

public class BinarySearchStrategy implements SearchStrategy {
    public int search(int[] array, int key) {
        // Implement binary search algorithm
    }
}

public class SearchAlgorithm {
    private SearchStrategy strategy;
    
    public SearchAlgorithm(SearchStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    
    public int search(int[] array, int key) {
        return strategy.search(array, key);
    }
    
    public void setStrategy(SearchStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
}
```

###### Template Method Pattern

- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to provide specific behavior for certain steps.

Example: A web application that needs to implement a login process that varies depending on the type of user (e.g. admin, regular user, etc.).

```java
public abstract class LoginTemplate {
    public final void login() {
        enterCredentials();
        authenticateCredentials();
        if (validateSession()) {
            redirect();
        } else {
            displayError();
        }
    }
    
    protected abstract void enterCredentials();
    protected abstract void authenticateCredentials();
    
    protected boolean validateSession() {
        // Implement default session validation logic
        return true;
    }
    
    protected abstract void redirect();
    protected abstract void displayError();
}

public class AdminLogin extends LoginTemplate {
    protected void enterCredentials() {
        // Implement admin login credentials input
    }
    
    protected void authenticateCredentials() {
        // Implement admin login authentication logic
    }
    
    protected void redirect() {
        // Implement admin login redirect logic
    }
    
    protected void displayError() {
        // Implement admin login error display logic
    }
}
public class UserLogin extends LoginTemplate {
    protected void enterCredentials() {
        // Implement user login credentials input
    }
    
    protected void authenticateCredentials() {
        // Implement user login authentication logic
    }
    
    protected boolean validateSession() {
        // Implement user session validation logic
        return false;
    }
    
    protected void redirect() {
        // Implement user login redirect logic
    }
    
    protected void displayError() {
        // Implement user login error display logic
    }
}
```
